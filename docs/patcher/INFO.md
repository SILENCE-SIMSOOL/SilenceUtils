## ❗ Disable Patcher Mod
SilenceUtils already internally **includes** the features provided by Patcher.  
Therefore, running Patcher alongside it will apply the same functionality twice, which can not only degrade performance but also cause **conflicts or unexpected errors**.  
For stable use, please **remove or disable the standalone Patcher mod**.

## ❓ Why were Patcher features added?
SilenceUtils requires certain features that overlap with Patcher.  
Additionally, Patcher’s optimization options have been **tuned for SkyBlock** in SilenceUtils, providing significantly better performance.  
To maintain SilenceUtils’ goals of being **independent** and prioritizing **performance while reducing unnecessary redundant calculations**, most of Patcher’s functionalities were incorporated directly into SilenceUtils.
