## ‚ùì What is SILENCE UTILS

**Silence Utils** is a **Forge mod** that supports **Minecraft 1.8.9**.
This mod was created for **Hypixel Skyblock**, especially focusing on dungeons, and provides helpful features for major gameplay in Skyblock.
Besides Skyblock, it also includes lightweight features such as **performance optimizations**, **convenient commands**, and **auto sprint**, improving the overall gameplay experience.

Originally, Silence Utils was a **private mod shared only with selected acquaintances** of the author.
However, due to high demand, it has now been made public.

Silence Utils was **first created in December 2022**, initially made for the **author's personal use**.
Although many Skyblock mods exist today, a lot of them include **bloated and unnecessary features**.
In contrast, Silence Utils is **practical**, **functional**, and **offers advanced capabilities**.
Moreover, it provides the convenience of **replacing all other mods with just one**.
Because Silence Utils is highly efficient, it greatly helps with **FPS improvement**.

## üõ´ Philosophy of the Mod

As mentioned above, Silence Utils **does not aim to create numerous miscellaneous features**.
Performance and gameplay quality are the highest priorities during development, with focus on whether the feature is truly useful and whether it significantly impacts performance.
That's why many requested features could not be implemented.
Also, since this is a **dungeon-focused mod**, heavy features unrelated to dungeons are not added.

Although Minecraft is a low-spec game, Skyblock players often use many heavy mods and play with low FPS.
Some people are forced to use heavy mods just for a few useful features.
To prevent this terrible performance drop, the goal is to create a mod that combines **performance**, **functionality**, and **convenience**.

The developer of Silence Utils is **Korean**.
There may be limitations in English support, including translations.
