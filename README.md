## ❓ What is SILENCE UTILS

**Silence Utils** is a **Forge mod** that supports **Minecraft 1.8.9**.
This mod was created for **Hypixel Skyblock**, especially focusing on dungeons, and provides helpful features for major gameplay in Skyblock.
Besides Skyblock, it also includes lightweight features such as **performance optimizations**, **convenient commands**, and **auto sprint**, improving the overall gameplay experience.

Originally, Silence Utils was a **private mod shared only with selected acquaintances** of the author.
However, in response to many requests, we have decided to make it public.

Silence Utils was **first created in December 2022**, initially made for the **author's personal use**.
Although many Skyblock mods exist today, many of them are packed with **heavy and unnecessary features** that go beyond what’s actually needed.
In contrast, Silence Utils is **practical**, **highly functional**, and offers **advanced** features. It also offers the convenience of **replacing multiple mods with a single mod**.
Thanks to its high efficiency, Silence Utils significantly improves performance and can lead to noticeable **FPS improvement**.

## 🛫 Vision of the mod

As mentioned above, Silence Utils **does not aim to add as many miscellaneous features as possible**.
In developing the mod, we focus first and foremost on performance and gameplay experience. Every feature is added only after considering how useful it really is and whether it affects performance more than it helps.
That's why many requested features could not be implemented.
Also, since this is a **dungeon-focused mod**, heavy features unrelated to dungeons are not added.

Although Minecraft is a low-spec game, Skyblock players often use many heavy mods and play with low FPS.
Many users end up having to use heavy mods loaded with unnecessary features just to get a few features that are only available in those specific mods. 
To prevent this terrible performance drop, the goal is to create a mod that combines **performance**, **functionality**, and **convenience**.

The developer of Silence Utils is **Korean**.
There may be limitations in English support, including translations.
