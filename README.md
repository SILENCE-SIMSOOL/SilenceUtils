## ‚ùì WHAT IS SILENCE UTILS
**Silence Utils** is a **Forge mod** that supports **Minecraft 1.8.9**.  
It is made for **Hypixel Skyblock** gameplay, especially focused on dungeons and major Skyblock content.  
Outside Skyblock, it also includes lightweight features to improve **performance**, **easy commands**, **auto sprint**, and other quality-of-life functions.  

Everything about the mod is **solely developed by the author**, with feedback and bugfix help from friends.  
As the author is primarily a **player**, not a developer, there may be limitations, but this also brings advantages from a player‚Äôs perspective.  

Originally, Silence Utils was a **private mod shared only with selected friends**.  
Because of this, there are many features in other mods that **originally came from my mod**.  

Silence Utils was **first created in December 2022**, initially **for personal use**.  
Nowadays there are many Skyblock mods, but many include **bloated, unnecessary features**.  
The purpose was to make **features I needed that Skytils lacked or did poorly**.  

[Skytils](https://github.com/Skytils/SkytilsMod) is truly **the best Skyblock mod** with tons of features.  
Though heavy, it's **very clean and well-optimized**, not eating away your PC performance.  
It has **practical, essential features** without junk.  

I mention Skytils to explain **why Silence Utils exists** and **what character it has**.  
Silence Utils is designed to **complement Skytils as the main mod**, adding **missing or new features**.  
I **strongly recommend using Skytils**, and Silence Utils is a must-have alongside it.  
Personally, I only use [SilenceUtils](https://github.com/SILENCE-SIMSOOL/SilenceUtils-Documentation), [Skytils](https://github.com/Skytils/SkytilsMod), [OneflowWaterSolver](https://github.com/Desco1/WaterSolver), and [Patcher](https://github.com/Sk1erLLC/Patcher).  

## üõ´ DIRECTION
As explained above, Silence Utils **avoids adding too many unnecessary features**.  
When developing, I focus mainly on **performance and gameplay quality** and always check:  
**Is this already in Skytils?**  
**Is this feature truly useful?**  
**Is it too heavy for what it does?**  
This is why many feature requests could not be added.  
Also, being **dungeon-focused**, I avoid heavy non-dungeon features.

The creator is **Korean**.  
Very few Koreans play Skyblock.  
So I **actively support Korean users** much more.  
That doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs no support for foreigners, but English help may be limited.  

## ‚ú® FEATURES FIRST CREATED IN SILENCE UTILS
These are mods **first developed in Silence Utils**.  
While I expected similar mods to appear over time, some have **stolen code and claimed it as their own**, so this is to clarify.
