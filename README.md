## ‚ùì About Silence Utils
 The Silence Utility Mod is a Forge mod that supports Minecraft version 1.8.9. This mod is specifically designed for Hypixel Skyblock, focusing primarily on dungeons and aiding key gameplay aspects of Skyblock. Aside from Skyblock, it also includes lightweight quality of life features, such as performance optimization, convenient commands, and an auto-sprint feature, all of which improve the quality of the game experience.

Everything in the mod was solely developed by the author, with assistance from several acquaintances in feedback and bug fixes. The author is primarily a player rather than a developer, so development isn't the main focus. However, I believe that this perspective as a fellow player offers certain advantages.

Originally, Silence Utils was a private mod shared only between selected acquaintances. Currently, there are many features in other available mods that were originally introduced in Silence Utils mod.

Silence Utils was first developed in December 2022, initially created for the author's personal use. Although Skyblock mods have become quite diverse recently, many mods are filled with heavy and unnecessary features that go beyond what is actually needed. Therefore, this mod was originally created to add the necessary features that were either missing or insufficient in the Skytils mod.

Speaking of the Skytils mod, it is one of the best Skyblock mods, packed with numerous features. Although it is one of the "heaviest" mods among Skyblock mods, it is extremely clean and well-optimized, so it doesn‚Äôt drain computer performance.

The reason for mentioning the Skytils mod was to explain the origins of Silence Utils and the characteristics of Silence Utils. Silence Utils is designed to add features that were either missing or insufficient in Skytils.
Therefore, I highly recommend using Skytils mod, since it is an indispensable mod for skyblock gameplay.

In addition, here are the mods that I use: [SilenceUtils](https://github.com/SILENCE-SIMSOOL/SilenceUtils-Documentation), [Skytils](https://github.com/Skytils/SkytilsMod), [OneflowWaterSolver](https://github.com/Desco1/WaterSolver), [Patcher](https://github.com/Sk1erLLC/Patcher)

## üõ´
As mentioned above, the Silence Utils mod does not aim to include as many miscellaneous features as possible. When developing the mod, priority is given to performance and the quality of gameplay, with particular attention to whether a feature already exists in Skytils, whether it is truly useful, and whether a feature significantly degrades performance relative to its usefulness. This is why, despite numerous feature requests, some features cannot be developed.

The creator of Silence Utils is Korean. Currently, there are very few players in Korea who play Skyblock. As a result, the creator of Silence Utils provides support and assistance specifically for Korean users. Silence Utils also offers much more active support for Koreans. While support for non-Korean users is available, there may be limitations in the assistance provided in English.

## ‚ú® The mods first created by Silence Utils
These mods are the first mods created by Silence Utils. While it was expected that similar mods might appear during the time they were shared as private mods, there have been instances where others have falsely claimed these mods as their own by using the source code without permission. This notice is to address such situations.

## üí∏ 
As of July 9, 2024, the Silence Utils has transitioned to a premium model. This decision was made due to the guidelines of solo development, the increasing scale of the mod becoming difficult to manage, and the growing number of inquiries and requests. The time and investment required for development have increased significantly, and since development is not my profession, it hasn‚Äôt benefited me at all.

Continuing this as a mere hobby was turning into a free service that consumed my time, leading to this significant decision. To determine the pricing, I researched various paid mods, most of which are related to macros. The average price for these paid mods are around $37.50 USD, with some reaching up to $75 USD.

However, I have no intention of profiting from these mods, so I am offering them at a very low price, especially for Korean users. Additionally, I continue to support the free version, so there‚Äôs no need to purchase the paid version unless you wish to. Your support for the paid mod would be greatly appreciated, as it will help fund the development of better features in the future.
